Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) are fields that have led
 societies forward, birthing new industries and bourgeoning economies. I envision an Africa
 that capitalises on those laudable hallmarks of STEM that are incessantly reiterated. The
 continent will value science education and implement the acquisition of applicable skills
 and tools of inquiry that the sciences foster. Students will be encouraged to embrace their
 creativity and market new ideas that contribute to local and international progress and
 development. The focus of education will shift from the testing of memory to the
 development of new ideas through individualistic topic exploration facilitated by novel
 technologies. New means of individualistic—more interactive—education include Massive
 Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and online resources like Khan Academy which are
 becoming increasingly accessible through increasing internet access and mobile devices
 (which currently stand at roughly 650 million subscribers) in Africa. Above all, the African
 perspective must be present in our education. As a South African, I have learned extensive
 European history and literature that I’ve seldom related to and which has therefore led me
 to undermine the achievements of Africans as a whole. My vision includes a dramatic shift
 that doesn’t exclude European history and literature per say but includes the vast
 multiplicity of local perspectives that would enrich our education.
